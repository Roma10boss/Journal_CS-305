# Client Summary:
Artemis Financial is a company that needed help with their software's security. The client wanted to make sure their software could securely transmit sensitive information, especially for international transactions. They were concerned about potential threats from outside hackers and needed to follow government rules for secure communications. Also, they wanted to ensure their software stayed up-to-date with the latest technology to keep it safe.

# Handling Vulnerabilities:
When finding security problems in Artemis Financial's software, I was able to pinpoint potential issues like a security gap that could let hackers change the data and a problem where the communication between their software and the database could be spied on. I did well by carefully checking the code for these problems. This is important because secure coding helps protect data, stops unauthorized access, and prevents attacks that could harm the company or its customers.

# Importance of Software Security:
Coding securely is super important. It helps keep sensitive data safe from hackers and stops them from stealing or tampering with information. Software security makes sure that a company's reputation isn't damaged due to data breaches or cyberattacks. It also prevents financial losses and keeps customer trust intact.

# Challenging Part of Vulnerability Assessment:
The challenging part was figuring out how to make the software even more secure. Also, understanding all the technical aspects of different vulnerabilities was tough, but it helped me learn a lot about cybersecurity and best practices.

# Increasing Security Layers:
To make the software safer, I suggested strong authentication and authorization methods, and I recommended using secure communication methods when talking to the database. This added extra layers of security to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches.

# Future Vulnerability Assessment:
In the future, I would use automated tools to assess vulnerabilities and decide which ways to fix them. These tools can quickly scan code and point out potential problems, making it easier to focus on critical issues.

# Ensuring Functional and Secure Code:
After rewriting the code, I tested it a lot to make sure it worked properly and was secure. I used various types of testing, like automated checks and manual reviews. To see if I introduced new problems during the changes, I did more testing, particularly focused on the parts I changed.

# Useful Resources and Tools:
I made use of essential tools to enhance the software's security and quality. Maven, a widely-used build automation and project management tool, enabled me to effectively handle project dependencies. Additionally, I used Eclipse Integrated Development Environment to help in scrutinizing and refining the codebase. 

# Showing Skills to Employers:
From this assignment, I can show future employers that I'm good at finding and fixing security issues in software. I can also demonstrate that I understand the importance of secure coding and have practical experience in implementing security measures. This assignment proves my ability to think critically, communicate clearly, and improve the safety of software applications.
